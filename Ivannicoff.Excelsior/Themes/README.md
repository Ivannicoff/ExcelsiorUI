# Themes (Auto-generated)

This folder contains the final XAML ResourceDictionary files compiled into the project assembly.

These files are produced by the **XAMLCombiner.ps1** script using source files from the `Resources` folder.

Important:

- Only the XAML files in this folder are included in the compilation process.
- Each file here is a `ResourceDictionary`.
- These files are auto-generated and overwritten on every build.
- Do not edit these files directly.
- To make changes, update the source files under `Resources`.

For full details on the generation process, see `BuildScripts/Prebuild/XAMLCombiner.ps1`.
