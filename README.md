# Excelsior UI Framework

Excelsior UI Framework is a modern, lightweight WPF control and theme library in active development, designed for line-of-business applications that demand fast, fluid interfaces. It draws inspiration from the Fluent Design System—offering the same clean, contemporary look without duplicating its full complexity—by minimizing brushes, flattening template hierarchies, and optimizing for high performance.

The library focuses on a core set of essential controls—text inputs, toggles, data grids—styled coherently and optimized for intensive data-entry workflows. By emphasizing conceptual simplicity over feature bloat, Excelsior UI lays a responsive, maintainable foundation that can grow as application needs evolve.
